# Topic Preview
- Lots of info on current state of research + current updated understanding of stellar flares
- Commonly seen in cool half of HR diagram
- Both positive and negative eeffects on near stellar environment
- Flares occur as part of eruptive events
- Particle accerlation is an important aspect of stellar flares

# Flares
- Sporadic increase in intensity occurring because of reconnecting field lines
- Start in corona, involve all atmospheric layers of star
- Many chemical processes involved
- Loop-like structure
- Often (on Sol), solar mass ejection occurs MeV →  GeV energy levels

# General Impacts on Exo-Planets
- Influences "exo-space" weather
- Flares increase atmospheric escape & destruction of ozone layers
- Flares' radiation possibly drive creation of macro-molecules that are building blocks of life

# Geo-Effective Aspects of Flares
- Coronal Mass Ejections
- Stellar Energetic Particles
- Validity of astrobio research relation/modules of CME+SEP effects on planets is still iffy

# Solar vs Stellar Flare Study
- Easy to study solar flares, hard to study stellar flares
- Scale difference (obv lol)
- Methods to compensate:
    - Type II Bursts
        - High association w/ solar flares, are created by CMEs
        - $\dot{\nu} = \frac{\nu \cos \left( \theta \nu_{B} \right)}{2 H_{N}}$
        - Very hard to find stellar-wise (rarely actually seen)
    - Dopplar Shifts
        - Evident Blue shift may imply prominence eruptions
    - Mass Loss Dimming
        - Missing "stuff" in star due to CME ⟹  decrease in brightness (coronal hole)
        - Relies on assumption that you are seeing same part of star
- Issue with assuming "large flare ⟹  CME", too much mass loss to be a physically accurate model (orders of magnitude greater mass loss than observed on Sun and than that which would be stable)
- Strong overlying magnetic fields limit amount of mass ejected (implied by models, not instrumentally validated yet)
- Emissions
    - Solar research uses nonthermal hard X-ray emissions and microwave emissions to study electrons
    - Stellar researchers can't do this
        - Instruments are too weak/effects are not strong enough
        - Can only use radio observations

# Particle Acceleration
- Recently found can detect mm wavelength flares
    - Short duration (very brief, < 10 sec + little P.A.)
    - High occurrence rate
- Happens very much (> 500 KeV) energetically, only recently understood to be high energy (and as such show up in UV & NUV spectrum)
- Seems UV & NUV flares happen more often than optical flares
- Current explanatory research that references flares focuses on optical flares, should probably add UV & NUV to future research
